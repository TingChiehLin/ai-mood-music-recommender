This project capitalizes on the positive uses of music as a quick and efficient way to regulate one's emotions through the use of AI that can select the attributes of the selected music related to the moods the user wishes to regulate or change. For instance, the user can select moods through texts or emojis, or even the use of slider options. The AI can decide the best type of music based on factors like tempo, keys, genres, and instrumentation that can influence the mood the user wishes to develop. This service is user-friendly with links to private videos on YouTube. The best options for the user to choose are shown at the end.
